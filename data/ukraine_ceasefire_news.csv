8becb1dca4761c2ebcf83a4d96693647,"Trump says no ground troops, but maybe air support for Ukraine peace","STORY: :: August 15, 2025U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he hoped Russia's Vladimir Putin would move forward on ending the war in Ukraine, a day after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House.But Trump conceded in an interview with the Fox News “Fox & Friends” program that Putin may not want to make a deal at all.Finnish President Alexander Stubb attended the talks in Washington on Monday and said later that Putin is rarely to be trusted, and it remains to be seen if he would come to a trilateral meeting with Trump and Zelenskiy.Olga Tokariuk, Academy Associate at Chatham House Ukraine Forum has similar concerns about whether Putin would meet with Zelenskiy.“Let's see if actually they agree to this meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy, because we know that in the past Putin has been really reluctant to have any meetings with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, because he does not see him as a legitimate leader, as a legitimate president, he does not see Ukraine as a country, a separate sovereign and independent state and a legitimate entity.""Trump on Tuesday again ruled out American boots on the ground in Ukraine and gave no specifics about the security guarantees he said the U.S. could offer Ukraine under any post-war settlement.A report from Axios said Trump was promising air support. Later, White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt was asked about this.""Look, that was something the president mentioned on his interview this morning. It is an option. It a possibility. I won't certainly rule out anything as far as military options that the president has at his disposal. I'll let him do that. I can tell you he's definitively ruled out boots on the ground.""Ukraine and its European allies have been buoyed by Trump's promise of security guarantees to help end the war - with Zelenskiy hailing Monday's talks as a ""major step forward"" - but he and the other European leaders face many unanswered questions, including how willing Russia will be to play ball.One issue is whether there will be a ceasefire. Trump said it isn’t a prerequisite for a deal, while European leaders continue to push for it.Moritz Weiss is chair for international relations at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.“What is, of course, really a problem at this stage is: we have no ceasefire. So that means Trump, in a way, succeeded in muddling through this, in a way pointing it away, saying he understands Putin and that he does not want it. So I think this is the critical issue, because of course when one party takes it as a precondition to have a ceasefire and the other one doesn't want it, there will be problems for further talks.”Russia has made no explicit commitment to a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Moscow did not reject any formats for discussing peace in Ukraine but any meeting of national leaders (quote) ""must be prepared with utmost thoroughness.""With the path to peace still deeply uncertain, Zelenskiy may be forced to make painful compromises to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. Analysts say more than 1 million people have been killed or wounded in the conflict.","Trump says no ground troops, but maybe air support for Ukraine peace

There's no deal until there's a deal,"" Trump said.He called the meeting ""extremely productive"" with ""many points"" agreed, although he did not offer specifics.""There are just a very few that are left, some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,"" Trump said without elaborating.Putin also spoke in general terms of cooperation in a joint press appearance that lasted just 12 minutes.""We hope that the understanding we have reached will... pave the way for peace in Ukraine,"" Putin said.As Trump mused about a second meeting, Putin smiled and said in English: ""Next time in Moscow.""The former KGB agent quickly tried to flatter Trump, who has voiced admiration for the Russian leader in the past.Putin told Trump he agreed with him that the Ukraine war, which Putin ordered, would not have happened if Trump were president instead of Joe Biden.Trump for his part again complained of a ""hoax"" that Russia intervened to help him the 2016 election -- a finding backed by US intelligence.Before the summit, Trump had warned of ""severe consequences"" if Russia did not accept a ceasefire. But when asked about those consequences during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity after the talks, Trump said that ""because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that now.""- Putin warns Western allies -The friendly reception contrasted with Trump's berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he met him at the White House in February.Trump earlier said he sought a three-way meeting with Zelensky but did not announce one at the summit.Trump said he would now consult Zelensky as well as NATO leaders, who have voiced unease about the US leader's outreach to Putin.""Now it's really up to President Zelensky to get it done,"" Trump said in the Fox News interview after the summit.Putin warned Ukraine and European countries to ""not create any obstacles"" and not ""make attempts to disrupt this emerging progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigues.""Trump invited Putin just a week ago and ensured there was some carefully choreographed drama for their first in-person meeting since 2019.The two leaders arrived in their respective presidential jets and descended on the tarmac of an air base, with Trump clapping as Putin appeared.US military might was on display with a B-2 stealth bomber flying overhead, as a reporter shouted audibly to Putin, ""Will you stop killing civilians?""Putin, undaunted, grinned widely as Trump took the unusual step of escorting him into ""The Beast,"" the secure US presidential limousine, before a meeting in a room before a screen that said -- in English only -- ""Pursuing Peace.""Putin smiled and joked with Russian reporters on the visit, a landmark for a leader who is facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court related to the Ukraine war, which has killed tens of thousands of people.- Battlefield gains -Russia in recent days has made battlefield gains that could strengthen Putin's hand in any ceasefire negotiations, although Ukraine announced as Putin was flying in that it had retaken several villages.Trump had insisted he would be firm with Putin, after coming under heated criticism for appearing cowed during a 2018 summit in Helsinki.While he was traveling to Alaska, the White House announced that Trump had scrapped a plan to see Putin alone and he instead held the talks alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his roving envoy Steve Witkoff. Zelensky was not included and has refused pressure from Trump to surrender territory seized by Russia.""It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,"" Zelensky said in a social media post.sct/dl/jgc","Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin made no breakthrough on Ukraine at their high-stakes summit on Friday, pointing to areas of agreement and rekindling a friendship but offering no news on a ceasefire.

5efa0d9f454771a3d944cb9f1fe4f677,"Trump eyes three-way meeting with Putin, Zelensky","US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he would seek a three-way meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin immediately after his Alaska summit with the Russian leader aimed at ending the three-year war in Ukraine.Trump spoke after what he described as a ""very good"" call with European leaders, including Zelensky -- even as Russian forces made their biggest advance into the Ukrainian president's country in more than a year.""If the first one goes okay, we'll have a quick second one,"" Trump told reporters as he was questioned about the face-to-face in the Alaskan city of Anchorage with his Russian counterpart, set for Friday. ""I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they'd like to have me there.""The high-stakes summit comes with Trump struggling to broker an end to the conflict, and Zelensky and his European allies earlier urged the Republican to push for a ceasefire.The stepped-up Russian offensive, and the fact Zelensky has not been invited to Anchorage, have heightened fears that Trump and Putin could strike a deal that forces painful concessions from Ukraine.The US leader promised dozens of times during his 2024 election campaign to end the conflict on his first day in office but has made scant progress towards securing a peace deal.He threatened ""secondary sanctions"" on Russia's trading partners over its invasion of Ukraine but his deadline for action came and went last week with no measures announced.- 'Severe consequences' -Trump warned Wednesday that he would take a follow-up meeting off the table if he felt Putin was acting in bad faith. ""There may be no second meeting because, if I feel that it's not appropriate to have it because I didn't get the answers that we have to have, then we are not going to have a second meeting,"" Trump said.According to an AFP analysis of battlefield data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War, Russian forces made their biggest 24-hour advance into Ukraine in more than a year on Tuesday.  As the war rages on in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky flew to Berlin and joined Chancellor Friedrich Merz on an online call with other European leaders, and the NATO and European Union chiefs, in which they talked to Trump and urged a united stance against Russia.The consensus was for Trump to secure a ceasefire, and Trump said Russia would face ""severe consequences"" if it didn't halt its offensive.But Zelensky also voiced doubt about Moscow's intentions, saying: ""I have told my colleagues -- the US president and our European friends -- that Putin definitely does not want peace.""Trump on Monday played down the possibility of a breakthrough in Alaska but said he expected ""constructive conversations"" with Putin.""This is really a feel-out meeting a little bit,"" Trump said. But he added that eventually ""there'll be some swapping, there'll be some changes in land"".Merz said Ukraine is ready to negotiate ""on territorial issues"" but stressed that legal recognition of Russian occupations ""would not be up for debate"".After the call, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Europe, the United States and NATO had ""strengthened the common ground for Ukraine"" while NATO head Mark Rutte declared: ""The ball is now in Putin's court.""- 'Wool over our eyes' -The Russian foreign ministry had earlier branded the frantic round of diplomacy ""politically and practically insignificant"" and an attempt at ""sabotaging"" US and Russian efforts to end the conflict.Despite the upbeat comments by European leaders, Russia's offensive in eastern Ukraine was gaining speed and seizing ground Wednesday.   Russia has made rapid advances this week in a narrow but important section of the front line in Ukraine. The AFP data analysis showed that the Russian army took or claimed 110 square kilometers (42.5 square miles) on August 12 compared to the previous day.

And it’s very important that, during this meeting, there could be a ceasefire obtained by the United States of America, and we support this initiative, as well as new prisoner exchanges and the liberation of children.”“The second element that was very clearly expressed by President Trump is that the question of Ukrainian territory can and will only be negotiated by the Ukrainian president. This is the position that we support, and it has been very clearly expressed by President Trump, and so this heralds our meetings in the future.” //“The question of occupied territories will be crucial elements of a peace negotiation. They are inseparable from the peace guarantees for the rest of the Ukrainian territory and for Europe, and so they cannot be discussed without the presence of the Ukrainian president at the table. Today, there is no serious scheme of territorial exchange on the table.” //The comments were among the first indications of what came out of talks between Trump, European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, intended to influence Trump as he prepares to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.Trump's insistence on involving Ukraine, if confirmed, could bring a measure of relief to Ukraine and its allies, who have feared that Trump and Putin could reach a deal that sells out Europe's and Ukraine's security interests and proposes to carve up Ukrainian territory.Trump and Putin are due to discuss how to end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict, the biggest in Europe since World War Two. Trump has said both sides will have to swap land to end fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions.","STORY: :: Macron says Trump wants Ukraine to have say on any territory talks with Russia
